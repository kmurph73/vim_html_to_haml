Convert a selection of html to haml.  Only works with rbenv *right now*

Demo: <a href='https://streamable.com/arp6' target='_blank'>https://streamable.com/arp6</a>

Just select the html you'd like to convert and run

`:'<,'>Html2Haml`

and it will open the converted html in a new buffer for your convenience.

Working on making it unnecessary to have to select text to convert it.

And also to have rbenv installed... first Vim plugin so it's slow going.  

Help and/or feedback is appreciated.
