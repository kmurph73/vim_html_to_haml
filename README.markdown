Convert your html to haml

if [vim-eunuch][1] is installed 'erb' is in the filename, it will be gsubbed with 'haml'

Just execute

    :ConvertToHaml

while on the buffer you want to convert to haml.

TODO:

* vim-repeat support
* convert multiple files to haml
* get feedback on code? (first Vim plugin)
