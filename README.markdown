Convert a selection of html to haml.  

***Not sure if it works with RVM, but it does work with rbenv and source-installed Ruby*** - PRs or tips welcome

Make sure either `html2haml` gem is in your path or installed on your default rbenv Ruby.

Just select the html you'd like to convert and run

`:'<,'>Html2Haml`

and it will open the converted html in a new buffer for your convenience.

Working on making it unnecessary to have to select text to convert it.

And also to have rbenv installed... first Vim plugin so it's slow going.  

Help and/or feedback is appreciated.
